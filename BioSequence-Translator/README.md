# Assignment Overview

### **1. DNA to mRNA Translation and Amino Acid Sequence Generation:**
- Convert a DNA sequence into its complementary mRNA sequence, using "U" instead of "T".
- Translate the mRNA codons into their corresponding amino acids based on the genetic code.

### **2. Codon Frequency Counting:**
Generate all possible mRNA sequences from a given amino acid sequence (up to three amino acids) and count the frequency of each codon.
